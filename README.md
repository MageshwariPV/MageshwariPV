### Hello! I'm Mageshwari PVðŸ‘‹

A recent MSc Business Analytics graduate from Warwick Business School, UK. I am passionate about leveraging the power of data and analytics to drive informed decision-making and uncover insights that propel business growth. With five years of experience as a Data Analyst in market research and competitor analysis, I have honed my skills in identifying market opportunities, and consumer trends. I am proficient in analysing large datasets to extract actionable insights and have experience in building machine learning models for various use cases. Additionally, I am skilled in developing mathematical models for optimisation.

During my MSc programme, I worked on several projects that showcase my skills and expertise. Some of the codes and results of these projects are uploaded here.

I have completed a variety of certifications and courses to further enhance my knowledge and skills in data analytics and business intelligence. You can view my certifications and courses here: [Certifications and Courses](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mageshwaripv25/details/certifications/)

I am always eager to connect with like-minded professionals and explore new opportunities. Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn or explore my work here on GitHub.
